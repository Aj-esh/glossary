Prompt engineering is the field of machine learning focused on optimizing the
input *prompts* that are given to generative machine learning models
to generate new outputs--such as text or images.

A subfield of prompt engineering is **prompt injection**--which focuses on the
construction of malicious input prompts that can modify the behavior of
a deployed generative AI system in a way unintended by its creator.

Prompt injection is analogous to other types of injection attacks in
computer security, such as [SQL Injection][1] or [Cross Site Scripting (XSS)][2]
